# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Approach

### API Integration
- The application fetches skip data from the API defined in the `.env.local` file:
  ```shell
  REACT_APP_API_URL=""
  The API call is made in the Home component, and the data is passed to the SkipList component for rendering.

### Component Structure
The project is organized into reusable components:
Header: Displays the navigation header.
Skiplist: Receives skip data and dynamically provides a collection of skipcard components. It acts as the main interface to present the available skip.
SkipCard: The skipcard represents individual skip with relevant details such as price, yard cube size and hire period. Each card is styled and structured for clarity.
Modal: Manages pop-up interactions using the useModal custom hook. Used for viewing detailed skip information.

### Styling
Tailwind CSS is used for styling, with configurations defined in tailwind.config.js.
Custom Material-UI themes are applied for consistent design.

### Routing
React Router is used for navigation, with routes defined in App.

### State Management
Local state is managed using React's useState and useEffect hooks. The three states managed are skips-used to store the fetched skip data, loading-used for tracking the loading state and error-stores the error messages if the API call fails.

### prop validation
Added prop validation for efficient error handling. First is the skipcard which includes size, hire_period_days, price_before_vat, allowed_on_road, allow_backup_wastel. Lastly the skiplists which includes the skips, loading and the error.
